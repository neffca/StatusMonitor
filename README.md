This is the very early stage so stick around. It should be up and running soon!

This application is designed to track a persons emotional state over an extended period of time. The idea behind it is for the user to identify key areas in their lives where their depression or anxiety is higher than normal. Through this, the hope is that they will be able to identify unexpected things that trigger this increase and work with a professional to get through them.

The full implementation will include:

A suicide hotline if the user selects "extremely depressed" as their status.
A messager system with emergency contacts and the ability for one of the contacts to signal to the others that they are responding.
A graph of the users emotional state.
A 'Did you take your meds?' prompt for users who take a regular medication.
Potential features:

A diary feature that flags key words during times of extreme anxiety/depression.
The optional ability for the user to allow the medical professional treating them to access certain parts of their data. This could be the graph of their emotional state, key words, and/or whether they took their meds.
